# GitHub Readme + WebTrends

To best understand which topics are popular and which subjects are trending in our developer communities, we can leverage [Web Trends](https://www.webtrends.com).

This is an automated tool created using [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=githubreadmewebtrends-github-bramin) that double checks each Readme to ensure every repository is leveraging [Web Trends](https://www.webtrends.com).

[Web Trends](https://www.webtrends.com) does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information and cannot be traced back to any individual user.
